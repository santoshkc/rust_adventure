My adventure and stumbling in the wonderful world of Rust.

This involves exploring one of the hardest problem of implementing doublely linked list with safe rust(followed linked list ebook for guidance).

Also, includes Threading, Rust Channels, Condition Variable, Mutex etc.

Need to explore crates like rayon for parallel processing in future
